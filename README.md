# Draw It or Lose It - Read Me

## Introduction
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
This document serves as a guide for the web-based distributed game application, "Draw It or Lose It," developed for our client, The Gaming Room. The aim of this project was to create a scalable, efficient, and secure software solution that prioritizes user experience.

## Documentation Highlights
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The documentation provided for this project excelled in articulating both business and technical requirements. It clarified design constraints and provided a comprehensive domain model through a UML class diagram. Additionally, the evaluation and recommendations sections offer valuable insights for future development.

## Utilizing Requirements during Coding
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The detailed requirements and constraints outlined in the documentation proved invaluable during the coding phase. They served as a guide for decision-making and ensured the development process aligned with client expectations. The UML class diagram facilitated a clear understanding of the domain model, making it easier to translate design concepts into actual code.

## Recommendations for Future Development
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
While the documentation is thorough, there is room for improvement in terms of security measures. Specifically, we recommend revisiting the Recommendations section to provide more specific guidance on encryption and authentication mechanisms. Including potential vulnerabilities and countermeasures will enhance the completeness of the document.
	
## User Needs and System Architecture
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Throughout the development process, user needs were carefully analyzed to ensure the system architecture prioritized scalability, efficiency, and security. By considering user needs from the outset, we were able to deliver a final product that aligns with client expectations and provides an optimal user experience.

## Approach for Future Projects
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Future projects can benefit from adopting a similar structured approach utilized in this project. A focus on iterative design, incorporating user feedback, and continuous refinement will allow us to adapt to evolving needs effectively. Additionally, giving more prominence to detailed security considerations from the beginning will be a priority.
